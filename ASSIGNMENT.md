# Final Project

For your final project you may choose a project that aligns with your own goals and interests.  I have listed several options below to get you thinking.  As you are considering your project, keep in mind that you should be aiming to demonstrate skill and understanding in one the course outcomes listed below.

## Some Project Ideas

* Develop a simulation model to run experiments on a real world problem (antibiotic resistance, ecosystem dynamics, diffusion through a membrane, ...).  You can use Project 9: Simulation Models as an example.
* Use Teachable Machine to train a machine learning model for a new application.  Use `Flask` to build a website that lets users interact with the model in some way.
* Find a data source and use data analysis tools like `numpy` and `matplotlib` to analyze the data.

## Project Phases

### 1. Proposal
Your project proposal must include:
    1. a written description of the final product you intend to create
    2. a list of the course outcomes that your project will demonstrate (should be at least 3)

Write your proposal in the **README.md** file 

### 2. Project Outline
Outline the overall structure of your code.  What is the file structure?  What classes will be created?  What functions?  What is the basic process your code uses to run?

### 3. Project Timeline
The project is due and will be presented to the class on Thursday, May 25 (the last day of class for seniors).  Thats 10 class days of work time including today.  To help you stay on track and for me to track your progress, please use the `TIMELINE.md` file in this repository to set a specific goal for each class date.  That will help me know what to look for in your code at any given time.  Set clear goals now based on your project outline.  It is ok to change your daily goals as you go; sometimes you get stuck and something takes longer than expected.  Just keep your timeline up to date as things change.  


## Required Outcomes
 
### Abstraction

Proficient Abstraction is demonstrated by students who usually and with feedback:
* breaks down problems into well-defined data structures, functions, and classes as appropriate.
* use variables appropriately to store information and simplify complex statements.
choose appropriate data structures for storing collections of data (lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries).
* break long, complex procedures into a series of simpler functions.  
* write functions in place of procedures that are repeated multiple times in a program.
* use predefined functions and methods from guided projects and imported libraries.
* attend to variable scope and avoid use of global variables when not necessary.

In addition to above, Advanced Abstraction is demonstrated by students who:
consistently and independently do the things listed above.
* use anonymous (lambda) functions where appropriate to write simple functions in-line. 
* create custom abstract data types (classes) with clearly defined interfaces.
* use sound superclass-subclass organization, obeying the substitution principle.

### Algorithms
Proficiency in Algorithms is demonstrated by students who constructs successful algorithms that usually and with feedback:
* use conditionals to control the flow of the program including those with multiple conditions/comparisons combined by boolean operations, as well as multiple nested conditions.
* use looping behavior, selecting for or while where appropriate and using break, continue, and return statements to maximize efficiency.
* incorporate effective use of list operations such as slicing, appending, and sorting by custom keys
* use comprehension to simplify list and dictionary operations
* use recursion to solve problems that can be broken into subproblems that are similar to the original problem such as when iterating through trees
* use classic algorithms such as binary search, merge sort, breadth-first search, and depth-first search.

In addition to above, Advanced work in Algorithms is demonstrated by students who independently design algorithms that:
* consistently do the things listed above.
* use exception handling as a control flow strategy where specific errors can be predicted
* use the most efficient algorithm possible to solve a given problem, trading time for space or space for time as appropriate.

## Writing
Proficient Writing of code  is demonstrated by students who:
* Follow community established conventions for a programming language (PEP 8 for Python) including: 
* Write clear, concise, and complete documentation (docstrings) of classes, methods, and functions following language specific norms.
* Use block comments to clarify blocks or lines of code following them.

In addition to above, Advanced work in Writing is demonstrated by students who independently and consistently do the things listed above.

## Optional Outcomes

### Data Analysis

Proficient Data Analysis is demonstrated by students who design programs that usually and with feedback:
* import data for processing from json and csv files
* use multidimensional arrays to represent complex data
* use libraries to create data visualizations to aid in analysis and communication of data including the choice of linear or logarithmic axes where appropriate
* analyze a large, complex data set to answer a question or test a hypothesis (e.g., analyze a large set of weather or financial data to predict future patterns)

In addition to above, Advanced work in Data Analysis is demonstrated by students who independently design programs that consistently do the things listed above.

### Modeling

Proficient Modeling is demonstrated by students who design programs that usually and with feedback:
* create models and simulations that are designed to help investigate real world problems
* create models that are flexible, allowing users to manipulate important variables
run computational models and simulations to generate data that helps answer real world problems

In addition to above, Advanced work in Modeling  is demonstrated by students who independently design algorithms that:
* consistently do the things listed above.
* use machine learning to build and refine models by comparing them to real world outcomes
